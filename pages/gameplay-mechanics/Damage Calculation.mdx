# Crit Damage Calculation

During the Open Alpha of February 2024 when a shell hits an internal module its health value reduces by the value of the base shell damage attribute which can be +/- 15% (Base Damage). This means module damage doesn't effect damage to HP in any sort of way and this illustration clarifies a lot of confusion on how crit modifier is calculated. 

## Universal Modifiers Values:
Fuel Tanks and Engines have a modifiers of 1.0 
Ammo has a 1.5modifier. 

These Modifiers (Universal Mod) are then multiplied by a tanks own Crit Modifier and this is how lower base damage tanks can have higher crit damage than another tank with less base damage. 

### Note:
All universal modifiers are the same for all tanks however, the total crit damage can be reduced by damage reduction modifiers like defenders have. We still don't know how this damage reduction comes into the equation but it can either reduce the unversal modifier or the entire damage calculation. This means it could be one of the best surviability tools to have as an agent. There is also the opposite of this where tanks like udarnik with its final module upgrade could take increased ammo rack damage.

# Crit Damage Registering

Crits for different ammo, guns and penetration are different. HEAT and APCR have different chances of critting a module and with this I mean CW has a similar system to War Thunder where a shell will first enter the tank unpon penetration and the shell will hit a varied space in a cone shape.

## Ammo Types:
HEAT:
Has a much larger cone than APCR which means you have a larger area where you can hit internal modules compared to them. This in turns means when specifically aiming for crit spots you don't have to be as accurate. HEAT also generally has higher crit damage compared to APCR.

APCR:
This ammo has less of a cone when penetrating a tank so this means you have to be more percise with your shots.

Another factor that effects the cone of internal damage hitting a tank is penetraton, arguably more important. This doesn't just effect if you penetrate and deal damage to a tank but how far this cone travels through an internal hitbox of a tank. This in turn means tanks with higher pen such as ray can penetrate tanks frontally and deal damage to modules quite far into tanks compared to a tank firing the same amunintion with lower penetration.

In turn this means tanks with high pen firing something like HEAT ATGMs can crit more often compared to something like blitz for example firing low pen APCR rounds.

### Note: 
Its unknown whether or not caliber also effects this.
